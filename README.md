- Store data in MongoDB as a data lake.
- Migrate data to SQL database for analysis.

### Approach:
1. **Set up Streamlit app**: Create a UI for user interaction.
2. **Connect to YouTube API**: Retrieve channel and video data.
3. **Store data in MongoDB**: Use MongoDB for flexible data storage.
4. **Query SQL database**: Perform analysis on stored data.
5. **Visualize results**: Display insights using Streamlit's visualization features.

### How to Use:
1. Enter YouTube Channel IDs.
2. Extract data or save to MongoDB.
3. Analyze stored data through predefined questions.
4. View trends via charts and tables.
